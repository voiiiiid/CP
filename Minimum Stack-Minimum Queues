Since we know we can add or remove an element from stack and queue in O(1) time.
Here we will find out how can we find the minimum element from stack or queue in O(1) time.

For this in Stack we can modify our stack like this:

```
def solve(arr):
// here is the stack which stores the element in this format [[curr_element, min_element till now]]
    stack = []

    for i in arr:
        if not stack:
//if the stack is empty then the min_element in the stack is this itself
            stack.append([i, i])
        else:
// if there are elements present in this then we have to just check and update the minimum.
            stack.append([i, min(i, stack[-1][1])])

    return stack
```
